Building and running tests with Android
=======================================

The easiest way to build libaddressinput for Android and run all the tests is
using the Gradle project automation tool:

Prerequisite dependencies for using Gradle with Android
-------------------------------------------------------
Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
or
Android SDK Tools: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other

Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to the root of the SDK.

Install the following packages:
* Tools/Android SDK Build-tools (Rev. 21.1.2)
* Android 5.1 (API 22)
* Extras/Android Support Library

Gradle (latest version):
  https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.3-bin.zip

Note: Additionally you must take care to avoid having multiple versions of
Gradle on your path, as this can cause problems.


Building and Running
--------------------
After installing all the prerequisites, check that everything is working by
running:

$ gradle build

With an Android emulator running or an Android device connected, the following
command line then builds the library and runs the tests:

$ gradle connectedInstrumentTest

The test runner logs to the system log, which can be viewed using logcat:

$ adb logcat
