  // The field is not null and not whitespace, and the field should not be used

  // field is unused, so its presence is an error.
  UNEXPECTED_FIELD,

  // The field is null or whitespace, and the field is required. For example,
  // in the U.S. ADMIN_AREA is a required field.
  MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD,

  // A list of values for the field is defined and the value does not occur in
  // the list. Applies to hierarchical elements like REGION, ADMIN_AREA,
  // LOCALITY, and DEPENDENT_LOCALITY. For example, in the US, the values for
  // ADMIN_AREA include "CA" but not "XX".
  UNKNOWN_VALUE,

  // A format for the field is defined and the value does not match. This is
  // used to match POSTAL_CODE against the format pattern generally. Formats
  // indicate how many digits/letters should be present, and what punctuation is
  // allowed. For example, in the U.S. postal codes are five digits with an
  // optional hyphen followed by four digits.
  INVALID_FORMAT,

  // A specific pattern for the field is defined based on a specific sub-region
  // (an ADMIN_AREA for example) and the value does not match. This is used to
  // match POSTAL_CODE against a regular expression. For example, in the U.S.
  // postal codes in the state of California start with '9'.
  MISMATCHING_VALUE,

  // The value contains a P.O. box and the widget options have acceptPostal set
  // to false. For example, a street address line that contained "P.O. Box 3456"
  // would fire this error.
