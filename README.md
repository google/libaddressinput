[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/googlei18n/libaddressinput.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/googlei18n/libaddressinput)

The _libaddressinput_ project consists of two different libraries (one
implemented in C++, one implemented in Java for Android) that use
[address metadata](https://github.com/googlei18n/libaddressinput/wiki/AddressValidationMetadata)
from
[Google](https://developers.google.com/)'s
[Address Data Service](https://chromium-i18n.appspot.com/ssl-address/data)
to assist application developers in collecting and handling _postal addresses_
from all over the world.

These libraries can provide information about what input fields are required for
a correct address input form for any country in the world and can validate an
address to highlight input errors like missing required fields or invalid
values.

## C++

The C++ library (in very portable C++03) of _libaddressinput_ is used in address-related
projects in [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home).
[requestAutocomplete()](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/forms/requestautocomplete/)
in [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home). The source code for that is a good
example of how to use this library to implement a complex feature in a real
application:

## Java

The Java library of _libaddressinput_ is written for use in
[Android](https://developer.android.com/) and includes an Android UI address
input widget ready for use, but only the UI parts are tied to Android.

Non-UI code and tests can be run in Java SE, and the rest of the library could
easily be adapted to run in any Java environment.
